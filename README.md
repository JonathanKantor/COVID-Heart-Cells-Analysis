# COVID-19 and Heart Disease: A Genomic Analysis
This project investigates the potential long-term impact of COVID-19 on heart health by studying transcriptomic profiles from SARS-CoV-2 infected cardiac cells derived from healthy human subject-induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSC). By analyzing single-cell transcriptomic data, we identified dysregulated subcellular pathways (SCPs) in fibroblast-like and ventricular cardiomyocyte cell-type clusters. These SCPs showed significant overlap with pathways associated with dilated and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, suggesting that COVID-19 may lead to long term heart disease. Our findings may aid in identifying susceptible individuals and developing targeted treatments.
